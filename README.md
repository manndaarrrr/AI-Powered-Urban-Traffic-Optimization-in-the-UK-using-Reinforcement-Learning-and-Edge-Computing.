# AI-Powered-Urban-Traffic-Optimization-in-the-UK-using-Reinforcement-Learning-and-Edge-Computing.
Developed an AI-driven traffic signal control system to optimize urban traffic flow. Built a Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent using PyTorch and integrated it with the SUMO simulator via TraCI. Simulated a Sheffield network, successfully reducing vehicle wait times compared to static controllers.
