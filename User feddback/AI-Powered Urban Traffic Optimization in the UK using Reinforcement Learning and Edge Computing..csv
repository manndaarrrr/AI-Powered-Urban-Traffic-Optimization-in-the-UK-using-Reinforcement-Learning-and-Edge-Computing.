Before seeing this dashboard, how familiar were you with traffic control or transport systems (for example traffic lights and congestion management)?","Q2. Before seeing this dashboard, how familiar were you with AI or machine learning?","Q3. When I showed you the traffic dashboard, the way everything was arranged on the screen (controls on the left [ manually adjust simulation step, max steps 3600 ], graphs in the middle) were easy to understand.","Q4. When I showed you the dashboard, how clearly could you see the difference between the Fixed time controller and the AI controller on the graphs?","Q5. When I showed you the main graphs (overall waiting time, queue length, vehicles processed, the intersection performance for each TLS, and the “AI vs Fixed-time” comparison graph), how easy were they to understand?","Q6. Based on what I showed you on the dashboard, how easy was it to see whether the Fixed-time controller or the AI controller was performing better overall?","Q7. When I showed you the dashboard, how would you rate the amount of information on the screen?","Q8. When I showed you the intersection level performance (for one   traffic light, showing   its queue and waiting time for Fixed-time and AI), how easy was this part of the dashboard to understand?","Q9.  Based on what I showed you on the dashboard, which controller looked better overall in terms of traffic flow?","Q10.  If this junction was in a real city and you had to choose one option, which controller would you prefer?","Q11. To what extent do you believe reinforcement learning based traffic signal control can adapt to changing traffic conditions in urban areas compared to fixed-time control?","Q12. How clear is the idea of using reinforcement learning (A2C) to select traffic signal actions based on traffic state (queue, waiting time, phase)?","Q.13 How appropriate is a two-action signal control policy (0 = keep phase, 1 = switch to next phase) for adaptive urban traffic control?","Q14.To what extent do you think edge computing (e.g., roadside units, sensors, cameras, and local processing) can support scalable and responsive AI-based traffic signal control in urban cities?","15 How feasible is it to run AI-based signal control at the edge (e.g., roadside unit/local computer), using inputs from sensors/cameras, rather than relying on a central server?","Q16. Based on what you saw, is there anything you would change or add to improve this AI traffic control system or its dashboard (for example, the way results are shown, extra graphs, different metrics, or other features)?","Q.17 In one sentence, what do you think is the main advantage of using reinforcement learning for urban traffic signal control?","Q.18 what is your opinion on using the A2C algorithm for traffic signal optimization?","Q.19 what do you think is the biggest challenge of applying reinforcement learning based traffic control in real UK cities?","Q20. In one sentence, what is your biggest concern about using RL (A2C) for real world traffic signals (e.g., safety, stability, trust, data quality)?","Q21. Based on what you saw, how useful do you think the SUMO traffic simulation is for testing and comparing AI-based traffic signal control before real-world deployment?","Q22. To what extent do you think the SUMO simulation results are realistic enough to understand how AI-based traffic signal control might perform in a real city?","Q23. which traffic measure (waiting time, queue length, or vehicles processed) did the AI controller improve the most, based on what you saw?","Q24. Please provide one comment or suggestion regarding AI based urban traffic optimization and do like this project?"
